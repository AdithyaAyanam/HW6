#I chose to answer this question because I thought it would be interesting to see how people reacted to often common habits in planes that can sometimes be an annoyance such as reclining a seat in a plane. It was interesting that there was a decent number of people that were willing to be open about how reclining a seat in a plane can be somewhat rude. I used the bar chart because it would the most clear when visualizing this data and I used numbers to show the sample sizes of the respondents although percentages could be mentioned as well in a separate graph.
